Test repo for Gaussian Process (GP) implementation

Matrix and Vector code is based on xlvector's Hector project. 
When GP eventually is done I will contribute it to Hector.

Hector:
https://github.com/xlvector/hector

Current algorithm is based on Mark Gibbs' PhD dissertation

I think using algoirthms in published academic research is fine, but since Hector does not have any lisence yet, please do not distribute this repo or use it for commercial purposes. lol
